# List Placeholder
A library to present a customizable placeholder view when a SwiftUI List is empty.
It provides a simple and convenient way to enhance the user experience by showing relevant information or UI elements when there is no content to display.


## Installation
Requires iOS 14+, macOS 11+, watchOS 7+ or tvOS 14+.

### Swift Package Manager

You can use Swift Package Manager to integrate ListPlaceholder into your Xcode project. Follow these steps:

1. In Xcode, go to "File" -> "Swift Packages" -> "Add Package Dependency".
2. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/javiergalera98/ListPlaceholder`.
3. Specify the version or branch you want to use.
4. Xcode will resolve the package and you can choose the target where you want to add ListPlaceholder.


## Usage

To present a list placeholder in SwiftUI, use the `.placeholder(for: items, content: view)` modifier.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import ListPlaceholder

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var contacts: [String] = []
    
    var body: some View {
        List {
            ForEach(contacts, id: \.self) { contact in
                Text(contact)
            }
        }
        .placeholder(for: contacts) {
            Text("No contacts registered.")
                .foregroundStyle(Color.secondary)
        }
    }
}
```
